# On Culture

## What Culture Is & Isn't

Culture is the ‘how’ behind everything that you do. 

Culture is your DNA. It’s what makes you you. It also much more than just the ‘being’ because it is also the “doing.” Culture informs what matters most and how you behave in the pursuit of what matters most.

Daniel Coyle in The Culture Code “Culture is a set of living relationships working toward a shared goal. It’s not something you are. It’s something you do.”

Often when startup culture is referenced images of free lunches, drinks, and having fun are conjured. While these are aspects of culture, the underlying values that they reinforce often are either at best unclear and at worst, unhealthy.

Culture exists. 
Culture always impacts results. 
Whether that impact is positive or negative depends largely on how healthy a culture is.



## Why leaders \<strike\>should must care about culture?

If you lead an organization and you care about succeeding then culture needs to be a top priority. In fact, I believe that a healthy culture is the highest leverage, highest ROI investment of time and resources for an organization. Yes...more than securing capital, more than growing revenue, more than building a great product. 

And here’s why…a healthy culture has an amplifying effect across every team member making each person more effective and efficient in their work. Not only that but the gains continue to pay dividends over time creating a compounding effect, so the sooner you tend to culture the sooner the benefit begins to build.
There’s data to back this up...a study conducted by Harvard Business School examined 200 company cultures and found that strong culture increased net income by 756 percent over a span of eleven years. And yes, eleven years is a long period of time, but the gains are real and I’ll show you how they can be unlocked starting today.
## Yet so few founders and leaders make the bet. Why is that?
They don’t know how and don’t have the time to stumble through it. This is why I built this guide and why outside support can help make it happen.

It feels risky. But, the risk of not making the investment is higher.

ut here’s the catch…if you don’t define it then it continues to define itself. At best it’s a missed opportunity to align on what matters most. But usually I experience an even darker side of not clearly defining your culture. Cliques form, departments resent one another, gossip becomes the way that information (and misinformation !) spreads, people start second guessing the leaders, leaders start second guessing the leaders. It’s all an incredible waste of energy and resources and a breeding ground for unhealthy stress.

Perhaps most simply the reason to care about culture is elicited in Hubspot’s culture decks which asks the question: “Whether planed or not, all companies have a culture. So why not create a culture we love?” https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34234/the-hubspot-culture-code-creating-a-company-we-love.aspx

## What makes a healthy company culture?
I often hear this question phrased as “What makes a good company culture?” It seems like the same question but infers that there is some ideal to live up to in an organization's culture. There isn’t. Rather it’s mores the case that unhealthy cultures lead to more bad things happening and healthy cultures foster good things happening. There isn’t a right or correct culture that you need to figure out and adhere to.

Three things make a healthy culture:
- The Culture is Defined
- The Culture is Communicated
- The Culture is Built Upon
	- Rituals
	- People


What happens in healthy cultures:
- Everyone in your organizations makes quicker, better decisions.
- People are energized by getting to put their energy toward something that they believe in, a place of work that honors who they are and the impact they want to have.
- There are fewer fires to put out. Leaving more headspace for execution and proactivity.
- You’ll hire more people who will thrive in your organization.
- Similarly, it becomes much clearer who might be the wrong fit and may need to be let go (this is often both for their sake and the organizations). \<\<article here\>\>
- You establish an organization that develops new leaders for your business and for our world.

Look..if you’re not sold by now, read no further.
If you are, then you’re probably wondering…so how do you create a healthy culture? Well, you begin by defining it…
## Understanding & Defining Your Organization’s Culture
Defining your culture is making the invisible visible. Getting clear on your identity. Making the choice to be proud of who you are and how you act.

When talking about defining culture I notice many leaders hold a fear of doing it wrong. And this fear stops them from looking deeper. The truth however it that there is no wrong as long as what you define is directionally correct.

“Defined and directionally right \> Unclear” so don’t fall into perfection paralysis. Embrace the journey, know that you can and will continue to iterate.

But for now, it’s time to get clear on why you’re here...
**Defining Your Purpose**
Your organization’s reason for existing is the foundation on which everything is built. Left unclear and each person will intuit their own purpose.

Your purpose serves as the scaffolding on which everything is built. It isn’t the building itself. The strategy and tactical approach come later but will be structureless without purpose.

Defining your purpose is best performed as a leadership team, done offsite, and when possible facilitated by a professional.

\<INSET why facilitation matters\>

Start at the beginning...Why do we exist?

In your responses, be as idealistic as possible. The details of how you’ll fulfill the purpose will come later. For now, let yourself and your team dream. And dream big.

Your aim is to define the core reason that you make the world better. It can be for you, for your customers, for the world, or any combination of the three. 

Your purpose must be true. It should light a fire inside you; make you feel something. I think you’re close when you feel the fear of “Could we actually do that?” In the end, it should inspire something of a “fuck yea” around the room.

**Creating a Culture Code: Defining the Essence**
Purpose is the beginning of the essence of who you are. The answer to “why you exist?” 

The other component of your essence is the answer to “how do you exist?” In this process you’re seeking to identify the underlying values, beliefs, and structures that enable you to be your very best in pursuit of Purpose.

Defining these pieces is simple, not always easy. Here’s one way to do it...
### Phase 1 - Exploring

Start by exploring, gathering, and collecting what’s important and what’s not about how you behave, what you believe, what works in your organization, and also what doesn’t work.

The more people that you can engage in this phase, the better. Inclusion drives a shared sense of ownership of the process and gives everyone a heads up that the organization takes culture seriously and a process to define it is underway.

Use interviews, focus groups, and your own experiences to identity the defining stories and themes that drive your behaviors and have enabled your success to date.

A few questions that can help:
- What 2-3 people in your organization if you could clone them would best set you up for achieving your purpose? And then, what are their characteristics that make this true?
- What 2-3 people in recent or current times have most struggled to be effective in your organization? What characteristics about them caused them to struggle? What is the flip side of those characteristics?
- What makes your organization iconic, distinct or unique? What are some specific examples (notable, memorable, or impactful stories)?
- What is it that makes you excited to come to work everyday?

The goal is to unearth as much as possible; capturing the words and stories that surface. Resist the temptation to start wordsmithing, that comes later. 

Once you have the necessary raw material, start to refine.
### Phase 2 - Refining

Taking all of what surfaced during exploration, combine and bucket everything into a handful of themes or areas that are most essentially who you are.

Get everything on a wall to make it easy to see patterns and begin to condense. Follow your curiosity. If something makes your ears perk up, go deeper and add.

From here the debate begins. Gather key leaders in the company and take turns pitching those that should be kept and those that can be discarded. The key question is always “Is this core to our essence - who we are and how we behave?"

Focus on grabbing hold of what is true, not on finding the perfect words to explain the truth. This comes in the next step.

Your goal should be to refine down to a handful of final themes. Fewer is better and you also need to balance that with needing to be complete in covering all of who you are. The
### Phase 3 - Crafting Your Culture Code
Once clear on the handful of areas that make your organization uniquely you, it’s time to find the right words, images, or stories that bring them fully alive.

Again with the leadership team gather offsite, if possible facilitated, to begin crafting the completed culture code. Taking the themes that you’ve refined, now explore the metaphors, inside jokes, key historical moments, and invigorating words that bring those themes to life.

Questions to consider: 
- Is this uniquely us?
- Is what we have complete? Is anything redundant or unnecessary?
- Where is there energy and where is the energy lacking?
- And finally, are we all committed to this being true and good enough to bring to the team as a whole?

\<Twilio & Hubspot\>
Your culture code can take whatever form fits for you and I’ve included a few examples to give you a glimpse of where you’re headed. Some organizations select short phrases that capture the essence. Some add on a sentence of description to be clear. Some add in stories in the company history,. Some add images or icons to create more clarity. One company I know of simply uses a single word and an image with no additional description acknowledging that part of their essence is allowing each individual to make their own deeper meaning. The only “right” way to do it is to create what is uniquely you. Resist the urge to copy and allow yourself to be inspired.
## Communicating Your Defined Culture

With your purpose clear and culture code defined, the hard work begins as you seek to enlist the team in taking ownership of the culture. 

Simon D’Arcy of Culture Builder captures this phase well: 

_“Most culture-change efforts fall short. The landscape is littered with failed culture change efforts. Successful implementation is counterintuitive._
_None of the usual methods work: it can’t be delegated, can’t be mandated, can’t be outsourced, can’t just be hired and fired, can’t be given to internal SWAT teams._

_To succeed, everyone from the CEO down to the janitor must be involved. Cultural fitness requires every person in the company to do their own pushups. The goal is to change company DNA and intentionally shape, build, enhance, and transform the culture of your team, organization and company. _

_To do this, you have to start with people: In fact, you need to build an army of Culture Builders.”_

It’s time to get everyone on the same page and involved...

### Setting Up the First Communication for Success

Call an all-hands meeting, letting everyone know the reason for gathering. The team should already be familiar with the ongoing culture effort from their involvement in the Defining phase and you’re likely to have a lot of positive, eager energy entering the room to see the outcome.

Leaders, and especially the CEO, should explain why culture is important, the process that was taken for defining your culture, and the outcome of the effort.

The key to a powerful meeting is simply this: Use the meeting to model the culture code in action.

Leave room for responses and feedback, but stand firm in knowing that what you’ve presented is true and will continue to evolve alongside the organization.

I also suggest finding ways to immediately create conversations around the culture code. Perhaps break into small groups to spend time brainstorming ways they could personally put these ways of being into action starting today. In the coming days, have team leads spark similar conversations with their team.

Your culture code needs to be communicated over and over. There is no such thing as talking about it too much.

It also needs to be built on in action by your people.
## How to Build Culture

### How You Behave
It’s not possible to be intentional around building culture without first defining what you want to build upon. But once defined, you embark on an ongoing process of bringing more fully to life what you value most.

The uniqueness of your culture wi
- Rituals
	- How meetings are run
	- How you give and receive feedback
	- How you communicate
		- What you choose to communicate and not to.
		- How things are communicated
			- There’s a big difference between getting updates via email vs. from your manager vs. at all-hands meetings vs. hearing it as gossip.
	- How you onboard is a key process that needs special attention to help new hires get up and running in your culture. There will be some things that new employees will need to discover over time, your culture cannot be one of those things. Onboarding into the culture must be intentional and explicit.
### Who You Are
- Hiring
	- Your culture code should be made explicit in the hiring process. 
		- Doing so helps you avoid hiring the wrong people.
		- This maintains internal conversations around the culture. 
		- It gives candidates a taste of who you are and how you work. It makes it clear 
	- When Someone Isn’t a Cultural Fit
	- Explore
	- Say Goodbye
		- Firing
